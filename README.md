# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### This project aims to assist Steve and his parents in Daqo's stock (DQ) and whether they should invest. We examined stock data to find the total daily volume, or shares traded throughout the day, and yearly return for each stock, or difference in price from beginning to end of year. Data was analyzed for the years 2017 and 2018.

## Results

### Performance of all stocks is shown below. In 2017 DQ did perform much better than in 2018 with a return percentage of 199.4% versus -62.6% respectively. It seems all stocks but TERP had a positive return in 2017. in 2018 only two stocks, ENPH and RUN had a positive return.

### After adjusting the original script for this analysis, our run time was much lower at 0.11 seconds for year 2017 and 0.01 seconds for year 2018. The original scripts took almost a full second to run.

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
